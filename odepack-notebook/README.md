## Docker Image for Octave with ODE package and Jupyter Notebook.

This Docker image is for Octave with ODE package and Jupyter Notebook. This images inherits [compdatasci/octave-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/compdatasci/octave-notebook). 

[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/compdatasci/odepack-notebook/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://hub.docker.com/r/compdatasci/odepack-notebook)

## Running Jupyter Notebook

To install Docker for your platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux, cloud platforms, etc.), follow the instructions at [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/step_one/).

Once you have Docker installed, you can start Jupyter Notebook using the following command in the directory that contains your notebook (e.g., ode-intro.ipynb):
```
    docker-notebook -i odepack-notebook ode-intro.ipynb
```
The `docker-notebook` script can be downloaded at <https://github.com/compdatasci/dockerfiles/raw/master/docker-notebook>.

## Running Jupyter Notebook with Docker Toolbox

If your version of Windows does not support Docker, you may need to [install Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/) instead. After you have installed Docker Toolbox, start it and run the following command in a Docker Toolbox terminal in your work directory:
```
     docker run --rm -w /home/compdatasci/shared -v $(pwd):/home/compdatasci/shared -d -p \
    $(docker-machine ip $(docker-machine active)):8088:8088 compdatasci/odepack-notebook \
    'jupyter-notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8088'
```

If successful, you will see some screen out such as:
```
...
Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time,
to login with a token:
http://0.0.0.0:8088/?token=2634a8f67ed91c582929e1a1137b8b3b400385b35afab19e
```

Copy and paste the URL into a web browser (such as Google Chrome). If port `8088` is in use, you can change it to a different port (say `8099`) by replacing `8088` with `8099 in the` `docker run` command.

When you have finished using Jupyter Notebook, use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).

## Running as Linux environment

You can also run the image as a Linux environment for Odepack. You can run the image using the following command:

    docker run --rm -ti -w/home/compdatasci/shared -v $(pwd):/home/compdatasci/shared \
    compdatasci/odepack-notebook:latest

which would share your current working directory into the container as `~/shared`. *Note that you should only save files under the shared directory because all other files will be lost when the process ends.*

Users with SELinux-enabled Linux distributions (Redhat, Fedora, CentOS, and others) will need to add the `:z` flag to the volume mount, e.g.:

    docker run --rm -ti -w/home/compdatasci/shared -v $(pwd):/home/compdatasci/shared:z \
    compdatasci/odepack-notebook:latest
